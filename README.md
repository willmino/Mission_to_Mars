# Mission_to_Mars
App for automated webscraping of data from the NASA Mars Mission website using python, BeautifulSoup, and Splinter

## Purpose

I generated a report of Mars data in python, using Pandas, Splinter and BeatifulSoup to automate web scraping of HTML code and data storage from the NASA Mars Planet Science website for news article titles and summaries. I also used Splinter to scrape Mars temperature data from the website's HTML table. The scraped data was stored in a Pandas dataframe and exported to a Mongo database and CSV file. I then analyzed the data using Pandas and matplotlib to generate weather statistics like the average monthly low temperature and pressure on Mars
